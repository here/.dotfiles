I enjoy working with:

* vim, sublime (text editors)
* git (source version control)
* tmux (screen multiplexer)
* irssi (irc)
* solarized (color scheme)
* oh-my-zsh (fancy zsh shell)

Includes a shell script 'land' which deletes existing dotfiles and sets up symlinks.

Feedback encouraged!

... obviously need to add a nethackrc at some point =)
